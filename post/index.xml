We also commissioned some nice new background art from AsPev as a replacement for our old one which was a little crusty. You can download a full resolution of it here.
Updated Playtest Schedule We&amp;rsquo;re moving playtests to a consistent schedule due to their popularity and developers wanting more feedback from the community on the state of the game.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report #26: Lītigium In Forīs</title><link>https://spacestation14.com/post/21-05-07-progress-report-26/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spacestation14.com/post/21-05-07-progress-report-26/</guid><description>Official Forums Space Station 14 now has an official forum! You can login to it with your SS14 account.
The forum will mainly be used for ban appeals and other administrative stuff so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty barebones for now. If it gets enough activity we&amp;rsquo;ll add more general forums and stuff.
Please read the rules before posting.
Content Physics Rework Contributed by metalgearsloth and Acruid.
A huge thanks to metalgearsloth for slaving over a complete physics rework for SS14.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report #25: Blowing Off Steam</title><link>https://spacestation14.com/post/21-02-12-progress-report-25/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spacestation14.com/post/21-02-12-progress-report-25/</guid><description>Playtest We&amp;rsquo;re proud to announce that Space Station 14 is now available through the new Steam Playtest feature. Originally we were planning to do a full release through Early Access, but we felt that a more limited release was a better match for the current state of SS14 development.
To gain access, simply visit the SS14 store page and click Request Access. You&amp;rsquo;ll be added to the pool of people who are waiting, which we randomly draw from when we feel we could use more players.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report #24: Atmos Sim Remake Now Simulates Atmos</title><link>https://spacestation14.com/post/20-10-16-progress-report-24/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spacestation14.com/post/20-10-16-progress-report-24/</guid><description>Barebones rounds! Throughout the years, we&amp;rsquo;ve put a lot of work into developing the engine and framework necessary for Space Station 14 to have playable content. Last year, we transitioned to developing player-facing features and gameplay in earnest, and we&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of progress in that short timespan!
SS14 now has playable, albeit barebones, rounds. As we add more features the number of complex interactions grows, and so does the need for testing the game with real players.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report #23: We Didn't Want To Wait Until Atmos Was Done</title><link>https://spacestation14.com/post/20-07-22-progress-report-23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://spacestation14.com/post/20-07-22-progress-report-23/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sadly atmos is not done yet.
