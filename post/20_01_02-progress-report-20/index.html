	<p>Writing progress reports is hard. Usually it isn't even writing the progress report itself, it's making the content we've added presentable.</p>
<p>We obviously still have a lot of work done the past two months. What wasn't done was actually polishing it to look good in videos and all that for the progress reports.</p>
<p>This is because my exams are coming up and I don't really have the time to polish everything up for this progress report. So I could either delay it <em>another</em> month, or I could show that we are not a dead remake by squeezing the engine changes dry I guess.</p>
<p>Guess which I went with.</p>
<h2 id="planning-for-a-steam-release">Planning For a Steam Release</h2>
<p>We're looking at signing up for Steam and getting the game on there. Steam provides many advantages for both me (developer) and you (player):</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenience. No need to register a separate account, install is trivial, everything's in your Steam library.</li>
<li>Automatic updates of the launcher. Changing the launcher is inevitable and annoying. We do have a method for telling the current launcher &ldquo;you are outdated, refuse to work&rdquo; but you still have to manually download a new one.</li>
<li>Using Steam's CDN for distribution. Means faster installation and us not having to pay for bandwidth.</li>
<li>Bypassing &ldquo;security&rdquo; features like code signing.</li>
</ul>
